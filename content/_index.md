## **The Very Mathematical History of a Perfect Color Combination**

Solarized creator Ethan Schoonover sought colors that would look good together have the same apparent brightness, and work on light and dark backgrounds.

I didn't think much of Solarized at first. But I soon found that I couldn't work with any other color scheme. Staring at screens all day can make you particular about fonts and colors.

The Solarized color scheme is no accident. It reflects the obsessive attention to detail of its creator, Ethan Schoonover. "I didn't release it until I was 1,000 percent sure I loved all the colors and they were all dialed in mathematically," Schoonover says. "I had multiple monitors, some were color calibrated, others were deliberately messed up. Sometimes I showed my wife, who thought I was a little nuts."
